# bankroll-marketdata [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/bankroll-marketdata.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/bankroll-marketdata) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bankroll-py/bankroll-marketdata.svg?style=svg&circle-token=b6f5a6badb0c783dd8c304171083b8b0439d8160)](https://circleci.com/gh/bankroll-py/bankroll-marketdata)

This library defines abstract interfaces for loading financial market data. Where such data is provided by a brokerage (as opposed to a general-purpose API), `bankroll-marketdata` also extends the abstractions of [bankroll-broker](https://github.com/bankroll-py/bankroll-broker).

This library is part of the [bankroll](https://github.com/bankroll-py) project.
